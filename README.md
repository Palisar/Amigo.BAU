affectionately known as BAU.
Currently, Softworks has no tool which decides who is doing BAU and when, all rotas are
created and maintained by hand.
Task

engineers at random to both complete a half day of support each. For the purposes of this

Business Rules
There are some rules and these are liable to change in the future:
● An engineer can do at most one half day shift in a day.
● An engineer cannot have half day shifts on consecutive days.
● Each engineer should have completed one whole day of support in any 2 week
period.

Deliverables
At the end of the task, the following must be included:
● A Presentation Layer
● An API
It is also important that you document your decisions as you will be expected to talk through
your approach.
